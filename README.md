# UnNano
A GUI Tool for Converting Thorlabs Educational AFM Data to 3D Printable Mesh (.stl)

UnNano enables the conversion of Thorlabs AFM data into 3D printable meshes in ~100ms, providing high-resolution visualizations of 20x20 micrometer samples. Normalization of inputs occurs but relative height differences are preserved.

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Directory**:  
   Ensure that the project is located in a folder containing a subfolder named `model_template`.

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Install the required dependencies by running the following command:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add AFM Data**:  
   Place your Thorlabs AFM output file (in semicolon-delimited CSV format) in the designated folder.

## Resolution Details

The input CSV file is first converted into a **normalized 32-bit TIFF**, which preserves the relative height accuracy from the AFM data. This TIFF file is then applied to a high-resolution mesh consisting of **652,864 faces**. This mesh has more than sufficient resolution to faithfully represent the height data at the highest AFM resolution of **500x500 pixels**.

- 1 row of pixels in the X-Y dimensions is set to **0** to fuse the mesh with its base layer.
- Blenderâ€™s built-in texture interpolation is applied by default to smooth the displacement across the mesh.
